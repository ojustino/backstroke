A Python package that allows users to create portfolio Strategy classes based
on a "safe core, risky satellite" model and simulate their performances on
historical stock data from [Tiingo's free API](https://api.tiingo.com/).

I created this repository because I wanted to research the purported dangers of
leveraged ETFs for myself. I tried sites like [Portfolio Visualizer](
https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/) and [QuantConnect](
https://quantconnect.com/), but ended up making my own Python package to give
myself more flexibility in creating strategies than the latter allowed *and* 
more visualization options than the former.

Now, I actually use a Strategy class to make decisions for my Roth IRA.

**Skills used:**

_(bear with me; I'm job-hunting)_

data(Frame) manipulation with `pandas`, fetching data over HTTP with `requests`,
object-oriented programming with abstract base classes, visualization with
`matplotlib`, cloud-based Jupyter environment creation with Binder and Docker.
