A Python package that allows users to create portfolio Strategy classes based
on a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-theory/08/core-satellite-investing.asp" target="_blank">
    "safe core, risky satellite"
</a> model and simulate their performances on historical stock data from
<a href="https://api.tiingo.com/" target="_blank">a free API</a>
hosted by Tiingo.

I created this repository because I wanted to research
<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-advisors/082515/why-leveraged-etfs-are-not-longterm-bet.asp" target="_blank">
    the purported dangers of leveraged ETFs
</a> (which magnify an index's daily gains and losses) for myself. I tried sites
like <a href="https://quantconnect.com/" target="_blank">QuantConnect</a> and
<a href="https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/" target="_blank">
    Portfolio Visualizer
</a> but resolved to write my own Python package to gain more flexibility in
creating strategies than the former allows *and* more visualization options
than exist in the latter.

Now, I actually use a `Strategy` class to make decisions for my IRA.
(_Naturally, your results may vary._)

**Skills used:**
<br>
_(bear with me; I'm job-hunting)_

data(Frame) manipulation with `pandas`, fetching data over HTTP with `requests`,
object-oriented programming with abstract base classes, visualization with
`matplotlib`, cloud-based Jupyter environment creation with Binder and Docker.
